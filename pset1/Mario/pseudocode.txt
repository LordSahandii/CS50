Let computer asks the ser for  height between 1 & 8.

If the user input were less than 1 or greater than 8, then go back to line number 1.

Let an integer be 1 and calls it (i).

Let and integer be 1 and calls it (j).

make a loop under another loop

in interior loop, lets print hashtags in condition that j is less than the input number and increase j by 1, then go back to the main loop

in the main loop print an empty line which directs to another line. and increase i by 1.

excute the loop after the two integers were equal to the input number.
